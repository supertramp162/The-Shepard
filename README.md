The Shepard

Free Max for Live Audio Effect

The Shepard is a Max for Live audio effect designed by Stephen Blackto generate continuous rising and falling Shepard tones inside Ableton Live. It uses fixed filter banks, clock-synchronised modulation, and stereo movement to create the illusion of endlessly ascending or descending sound.

The device is intended for musical, tempo-aware use rather than extreme sound design — making it suitable for ambient, experimental, cinematic, and electronic production.

Features

Shepard tone generation using fixed, overlapping filter banks

Clock-synchronised modulation for stable, tempo-locked movement

Rising and falling modes with adjustable direction and rate

Stereo spin / spiral panning for spatial motion

Visual spectrum display showing harmonic movement in real time

Designed for pads, drones, textures, and sustained material

Intended Use

The Shepard is not a traditional synth or delay effect. It works best when inserted on:

sustained pads

drones

noise sources

simple harmonic material

Rather than drawing attention to itself, it’s designed to slowly evolve over time, creating tension, motion, or atmosphere without obvious modulation artifacts.

Installation

Download the .amxd file

Drag it into Ableton Live

The device will appear under Audio Effects → Max Audio Effect

Requires Ableton Live Suite (or Max for Live)

Notes

All modulation is tempo-aware to keep the effect musically stable

Best results are achieved with subtle settings

Works well in combination with reverb, delay, or other spatial effects
